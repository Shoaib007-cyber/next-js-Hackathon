This is a Next.js project created using create-next-app.

## Getting Started

To begin, start the development server by running:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Once the server is running, open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see the application in action.

You can begin editing the page by modifying the app/page.tsx file. The page will update automatically as you make changes.

This project utilizes next/font to efficiently load and optimize the Geist font family, designed by Vercel.
